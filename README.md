# Analysim

Analysim is a free online web platform enabling researchers to analyze and share data by providing interactive visualizations, and collaborate with others.  The open platform is specialized for working with high-dimensional data sets such as those constructed via computational modeling.  Analysim also allows you to run custom analysis on any type of data.
